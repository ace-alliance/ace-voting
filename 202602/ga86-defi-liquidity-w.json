This format shall include a URL hosting a document that outlines additional context for the proposed governance action, and the hash of this document. The document hosted by such a URL shall be immutable and incapable of being altered after submission, and the content of every on-chain Governance Action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action.” This TWGA is unconstitutional on this basis because it utilizes a mutable, main-branch Github URL capable of post-submission alteration instead of the commit-hash URL that Github is capable of producing to ensure immutability.",
